# Getting Started with Delta with Classical ML

## Adding Delta to Your Project

To add the Delta library to your Rust project, you need to include it in your
`Cargo.toml` file. Follow these steps:

1. Open your project's `Cargo.toml` file.
2. Add the following line under `[dependencies]`:

```toml title="Cargo.toml"
[dependencies]
deltaml = "0.1.0"
```

Currently, we have published Delta to [deltaml](https://crates.io/crates/deltaml), but note that this is still
experimental in alpha stage so things might break in the upcoming iterations.

## Delta Usage Example

### 1. Create the `main` Function

We start with an empty asynchronous main function using `#[tokio::main]`.

```rust title="src/main.rs"
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    println!("Starting the Delta example...");
}
```

### 2. Coming more soon...
