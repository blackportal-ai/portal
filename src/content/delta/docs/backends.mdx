# Backends

We want to leverage hardware acceleration on as many platforms as possible to optimize machine learning workloads. While the current support is limited to CPU, but macOS with **Metal** is shortly being worked on as the next step, the framework is actively evolving to support a diverse range of computational devices.

## Current Support

Below is a detailed table of supported backends and their current status:

| Backend       | Description                                     | Current Status     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **CPU**            | Central Processing Unit, available on all platforms. | âœ… Supported       |
| **Metal**          | macOS-specific GPU acceleration using Metal API. | ðŸš§ Planned       |
| **CUDA**           | NVIDIA GPU acceleration using the CUDA API.     | ðŸš§ Planned         |
| **OpenCL**         | Cross-platform GPU acceleration using OpenCL.   | ðŸš§ Planned         |
