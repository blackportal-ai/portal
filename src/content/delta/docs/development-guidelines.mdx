# Development Guidelines

This page serves as a comprehensive guide for developers contributing to the
project. It provides information about the codebase, project structure,
workflows, and best practices. Whether you're a new contributor or a seasoned
developer, this page will help you work effectively with the codebase.

# Purpose

This page is intended to:

- Explain the overall structure of the project repository.
- Guide developers on how to set up, run, and work with the codebase.
- Highlight current limitations and known issues.
- Share best practices and conventions to maintain consistency.
- Document project-specific tools, configurations, and workflows.

### Contributing to Delta

We love contributions! However, note that it's important that you first talk to us
in [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/delta-rs/discussions) about what you are planning to do so we both save time
and effort. If it's only bug fixes or documentation, feel free to send PR, those are more likely to pass directly.

### Copypasta for license when adding new files

For all new files we create please add the license to the top of the files, see [`delta/src/neuralnet/layers/dense.rs`](https://github.com/blackportal-ai/delta/blob/master/delta/src/neuralnet/layers/dense.rs)
for an example.
