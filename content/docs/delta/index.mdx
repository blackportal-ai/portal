Delta is a high-performance machine learning framework written in Rust, designed
to provide efficient and scalable tools for classical machine learning tasks.
Built with a focus on speed and reliability, Delta leverages Rustâ€™s performance
and safety guarantees to deliver compute-intensive algorithms optimized for CPU,
with plans for future GPU support. The framework offers a growing suite of
classical ML algorithms, currently including Linear Regression and Logistic
Regression, with simple yet flexible APIs to support both beginners and advanced
users.
