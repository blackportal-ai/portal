## Nebula

Delta and Nebula are designed to integrate, providing a cohesive system for
machine learning. Here's how the integration improves the workflow:

1. **Access to Datasets and Models (future)** Delta can connect to Nebula's
   registry to access datasets and modelsâ€”both public and private. This removes
   the need for manual downloads or additional processing.

2. **Dataset Management (future)** Nebula handles dataset metadata, versioning,
   and dependencies. Delta integrates with this system, allowing users to
   retrieve specific dataset versions needed for experiments or production.

3. **Model Versioning and Publishing (future)** Delta supports Nebula's model
   registry for managing trained models. After training in Delta, models can be
   cached locally using Nebula's client cache and shared or stored in a private
   registry.

4. **Template Projects (future)** Nebula offers Delta-based templates to quickly
   set up environments for tasks like transfer learning or custom dataset
   handling.

5. **Transfer Learning (future)** With Delta and Nebula integration, users can
   retrieve pre-trained models, fine-tune them with their datasets, and publish
   the updated models back to Nebula with minimal setup.

More information about how to integrate Nebula into your Delta project will be
coming soon. Currently the estimated time is Q4 2025.
